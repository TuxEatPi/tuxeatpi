tuxeatpi
########

Poor Tux needs a new heart. We do that by feeding it a raspberrypi.

The end goal is to keep Tux's basic functionnality:

- Wings position detection, push buttons and movement
- Mouth movement and position detection
- Eyes position detection, photodetector and lights
- Head button
- Speaker and microphone
- Volume button


Other features considered:

- Voice recognition
- Webcam
- Voice synthesizer
